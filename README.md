# Scope

This the readme for the mycar project's frontend. To know more about the backend, please visit this [link](https://github.com/belovedpearl/mycar_drfapi).

MyCar is a specialized social networking platform tailored for car enthusiasts. It's name was derived from its core objective: fostering discussions and serving as a comprehensive guide for individuals passionate about automobiles. Through MyCar, users can engage in vibrant conversations, share their experiences with specific cars, and access valuable insights to enhance their automotive journey.

The interactive platform of MyCar empowers users to initiate discussions by adding their own posts, inviting others to contribute their reviews and insights on specific car topics. Through the platform, users can engage in dynamic conversations, expressing their opinions by upvoting or downvoting posts to stimulate dialogue about various car topics. Additionally, users have the ability to connect and establish friendships by following other users, further enhancing the collaborative environment of the platform.

The platform renders differently depending on the authentication state of the user. Non-authenticated users can view all posts, posts details, perform search and filter registered users posts, upvotes and downvotes. They are also able to register using the signup link on the navbar. In addition, Authenticated users can add post, add reviews, upvote and downvote posts. They can also follow another user and also unfollow them.

# Background

---

This project is inspired by the Code Institute's 'Moment' walkthrough project. As a passionate car owner, I've often considered the idea of a dedicated community for fellow car enthusiasts. A place where individuals can share their experiences, insights, and opinions about the cars they own or have driven. This community would serve as a valuable resource, providing a wealth of knowledge and guidance for those considering the same car or seeking advice on its usage and maintenance.

For novice car owners especially, having access to a pool of information about their vehicle can be invaluable. From understanding the details of its operation to estimating maintenance costs and uncovering tips for optimal performance, there's a wealth of information waiting to be shared.

This project aims to be the ultimate hub for car enthusiasts, offering a platform where users can explore, learn, and engage with others who share their passion for automobiles. Whether it's discussing the latest models, sharing driving experiences, or delving into the finer details of car mechanics, this community strives to be the go-to destination for all things automotive.
